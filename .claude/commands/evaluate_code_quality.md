  "prompt": "Evaluate code quality at $PATH for PCF components.\n\nMeasure PCF-specific metrics:\n1. Component Complexity:\n   - Lifecycle method complexity (init, updateView, destroy)\n   - State management patterns\n   - Event handler organization\n   - Dataset processing logic\n\n2. PCF Maintainability:\n   - ControlManifest.Input.xml alignment with code\n   - TypeScript type safety for ComponentFramework\n   - Separation of concerns (UI vs business logic)\n   - Mock context implementation quality\n\n3. Test Coverage:\n   - Component lifecycle testing\n   - PowerApps context mocking coverage\n   - Dataset manipulation tests\n   - WebAPI integration tests\n   - DevTools panel testing\n\n4. Documentation:\n   - PCF component usage documentation\n   - Vite vs webpack build instructions\n   - PowerApps deployment guide\n   - API documentation for custom methods\n\n5. PCF Best Practices:\n   - Resource cleanup in destroy()\n   - Proper use of notifyOutputChanged()\n   - Efficient dataset paging\n   - WebAPI error handling\n   - Security considerations\n\n6. Build System Quality:\n   - Vite configuration correctness\n   - Webpack compatibility layer\n   - Bundle optimization settings\n   - Development/production parity\n\nProvide detailed report with:\n- Letter grades (A-F) for each category\n- Specific PCF anti-patterns found\n- PowerApps performance implications\n- Concrete improvement examples\n- Priority-ordered action items",
  "completion_prompt": "PCF code quality evaluation complete. Claude has assessed the component implementation against PCF best practices, identified maintainability issues, measured test coverage, and provided specific recommendations for improving code quality in the PowerApps ecosystem."
