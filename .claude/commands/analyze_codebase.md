  "prompt": "Analyze the PCF Vite Harness codebase comprehensively:\n\n1. Generate directory tree focusing on:\n   - PCF component structure (src/, tests/fixtures/)\n   - Vite configuration and build setup\n   - DevTools integration components\n   - Test harness architecture\n\n2. Review key PCF materials:\n   - ControlManifest.Input.xml files\n   - Component index.ts implementations\n   - Vite vs webpack build configurations\n   - PowerApps context simulation\n\n3. Analyze PCF-specific requirements:\n   - Component lifecycle management\n   - Dataset vs field component patterns\n   - WebAPI integration points\n   - Redux DevTools panels\n\n4. Detailed project assessment:\n   - Dual build system compatibility (Vite dev vs webpack prod)\n   - Hot module replacement effectiveness\n   - PowerApps environment simulation accuracy\n   - DevTools integration completeness\n\n5. Create PCF feature checklist:\n   - Component initialization (%)\n   - Context simulation (%)\n   - Dataset handling (%)\n   - Field component support (%)\n   - DevTools integration (%)\n   - Test coverage (%)\n\n6. End-to-end testing analysis:\n   - Component rendering tests\n   - Lifecycle event handling\n   - WebAPI mocking coverage\n   - Integration test effectiveness\n\n7. Generate comprehensive report including:\n   - PCF component compatibility status\n   - Vite/webpack dual build analysis\n   - PowerApps simulation gaps\n   - Performance optimization opportunities\n   - Security considerations for PCF components\n\n8. Create .context/ documentation:\n   - pcf-status.md: Overall PCF harness status\n   - component-checklist.md: PCF component feature completion\n   - compatibility-issues.md: Vite/webpack compatibility findings\n   - recommendations.md: Specific PCF improvements\n   - deployment-readiness.md: Production deployment checklist",
  "completion_prompt": "PCF codebase analysis complete. Claude has analyzed the PCF Vite Harness structure, identified compatibility issues between Vite and webpack builds, assessed PowerApps simulation accuracy, and provided comprehensive recommendations for improving the development experience."
