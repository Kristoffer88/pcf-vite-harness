Performance analysis specific to PCF components\n2. Before/after code comparisons with metrics\n3. Impact on both Vite dev and webpack prod builds\n4. PowerApps runtime performance considerations\n5. Memory usage optimization for large datasets\n6. Network request optimization for WebAPI calls",
  "completion_prompt": "PCF code optimization complete. Claude has analyzed the PCF component performance, provided optimized implementations for both development and production environments, and included specific metrics showing improvements in bundle size, runtime performance, and memory usage."
