> **⚠️ CRITICAL WARNING**
> 
> This document outlines fundamental compatibility issues between Vite bundler (used by this harness) and PCF's webpack-based build system. Understanding these limitations is essential before using this tool.

## Overview

PowerApps Component Framework (PCF) uses a webpack-based bundling system through `pcf-scripts`, while this development harness uses Vite for fast development. These two bundlers have fundamental architectural differences that create compatibility issues.

**Key Point**: Code that works perfectly in this Vite-based harness may fail when built with PCF's webpack bundler for production deployment.

## Technical Architecture Differences

### PCF Webpack System
- **Bundler**: Webpack 5.x via `pcf-scripts` package
- **Module Resolution**: `"moduleResolution": "node"`
- **Output**: Single bundle.js file for PowerApps deployment
- **Dependencies**: All bundled inline (no external CDN references)
- **Environment**: Optimized for PowerApps container runtime

### Vite Development System
- **Bundler**: ESBuild (dev) + Rollup (production)
- **Module Resolution**: `"moduleResolution": "bundler"` (TypeScript 5+)
- **Output**: Modern ES modules with HMR
- **Dependencies**: Pre-bundled and optimized separately
- **Environment**: Modern browser features

## Major Compatibility Issues

### 1. Module Resolution Conflicts

**Problem**: Different module resolution strategies cause import/export failures.

```typescript
// This might work in Vite but fail in PCF webpack
import { someFunction } from 'library/esm/module'

// PCF webpack may require:
import { someFunction } from 'library'
```

**Root Cause**: 
- Vite uses TypeScript 5's "bundler" module resolution
- PCF expects traditional "node" module resolution
- Different algorithms for resolving imports

### 2. TypeScript Configuration Incompatibilities

**Problem**: TypeScript compiler options conflict between systems.

```json
// Vite default (may cause PCF build failures)
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "moduleResolution": "bundler",
    "module": "ESNext"
  }
}

// PCF expected configuration
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "moduleResolution": "node",
    "module": "commonjs"
  }
}
```

**Symptoms**:
- VSCode IntelliSense errors
- TypeScript compilation failures
- Module not found errors during PCF build

### 3. Dependency Bundling Behavior

**Problem**: Different tree-shaking and dependency handling.

**Vite Behavior**:
- Aggressive tree-shaking and dead code elimination
- Dynamic import() statements for code splitting
- External dependency optimization

**PCF Webpack Behavior**:
- Must bundle ALL dependencies inline
- No external script references allowed
- 500kb package size limitations
- Limited tree-shaking in default configuration

### 4. ES Module vs CommonJS Conflicts

**Problem**: Module format mismatches between development and production.

```javascript
// Vite handles ES modules natively
export { createMockContext } from './mockContext'

// PCF webpack may require CommonJS compatibility
module.exports = { createMockContext }
```

**Common Errors**:
- `ERR_REQUIRE_ESM` errors
- `Cannot use import statement outside a module`
- `exports is not defined`

### 5. Runtime Environment Differences

**Problem**: PowerApps container has different capabilities than modern browsers.

**Vite Assumptions**:
- Modern browser APIs available
- Native ES module support
- Full DOM API access

**PowerApps Reality**:
- Limited browser API subset
- Sandboxed execution environment
- Legacy compatibility requirements

## Real-World Error Examples

**This error was encountered by an actual user testing the harness:**

### ESBuild Native Module Error

```
✘ [ERROR] No loader is configured for ".node" files: ../pcf-vite-harness/node_modules/fsevents/fsevents.node

    ../pcf-vite-harness/node_modules/fsevents/fsevents.js:13:23:
      13 │ ..."./fsevents...
         ╵    ~~~~~~~~~~~

Error: Build failed with 1 error:
../pcf-vite-harness/node_modules/fsevents/fsevents.js:13:23: ERROR: No loader is configured for ".node" files
```

**Root Cause**: ESBuild (used by Vite) cannot handle native Node.js modules (.node files). The `fsevents` package contains platform-specific native binaries for macOS file system watching, which creates an incompatible build chain.

**Why This Matters**: This validates our core compatibility warning - code that works in Vite development may fail when integrated with actual PCF projects due to fundamental bundler differences.

## Specific Error Scenarios

### Build-Time Errors

1. **ESBuild Native Module Error** ⭐ *Real user error*
   ```
   ERROR: No loader is configured for ".node" files: fsevents.node
   ```

2. **Module Resolution Failure**
   ```
   Module not found: Error: Can't resolve 'module-name'
   ```



### Runtime Errors

1. **Module Loading Failure**
   ```
   Uncaught ReferenceError: exports is not defined
   ```

2. **API Unavailable**
   ```
   TypeError: crypto.randomUUID is not a function
   ```

3. **Import Statement Error**
   ```
   Cannot use import statement outside a module
   ```

## Development Workflow Limitations

### What Works in This Harness
✅ Rapid component prototyping  
✅ Fast development with HMR  
✅ Modern TypeScript features  
✅ React component testing  
✅ CSS/styling development  

### What May Fail in PCF Production
❌ Complex dependency chains  
❌ Large NPM packages (>500kb)  
❌ Modern browser-only APIs  
❌ Dynamic imports  
❌ External script references  

## Recommended Workflow

### 1. Development Phase (Use This Harness)
- Prototype your component quickly
- Test UI/UX with mock data
- Iterate on styling and behavior
- Develop core component logic

### 2. Integration Phase (Switch to PCF Webpack)
- Create actual PCF project with `pac pcf init`
- Copy component logic to PCF project
- Test with `pac pcf build`
- Fix any webpack-specific issues

### 3. Testing Phase
- Test in actual PowerApps environment
- Validate all dependencies work
- Check bundle size limitations
- Verify runtime compatibility

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue: ESBuild Native Module Error ⭐ *Most Common*
**Error**: `No loader is configured for ".node" files: fsevents.node`

**Root Cause**: ESBuild cannot process native Node.js modules (.node files) that contain platform-specific binaries.

**Solution**: 
1. **Accept this limitation** - this error proves the fundamental incompatibility between Vite and PCF webpack
2. **Use for development only** - don't attempt to integrate Vite-bundled code directly into PCF projects
3. **Follow the recommended workflow**: Develop with Vite → Copy logic to PCF project → Build with PCF webpack

**Why This Happens**: Vite uses ESBuild for fast bundling, but ESBuild doesn't support native modules. PCF's webpack can handle these files, but Vite cannot.

### Issue: TypeScript Module Resolution Errors
**Solution**: 
1. Check VSCode is updated to latest version
2. Ensure TypeScript 5+ is installed
3. Disable conflicting extensions (webhint, Edge Tools)

### Issue: Import/Export Failures in PCF
**Solution**:
1. Use CommonJS exports in final PCF code
2. Avoid path-based imports from node_modules
3. Test all imports with PCF webpack build


### Issue: Runtime API Unavailable
**Solution**:
1. Add polyfills for missing APIs
2. Feature-detect before using modern APIs
3. Use PCF-provided utilities instead

## Tools and Commands

### Check Bundle Compatibility
```bash
# Build with PCF webpack to test compatibility
pac pcf build

# Check bundle size
ls -la out/controls/ # Look for bundle size
```

### Fix Common TypeScript Issues
```bash
# Update TypeScript
npm install typescript@latest

# Reset VSCode TypeScript
# Ctrl+Shift+P > "TypeScript: Restart TS Server"
```

## Summary

This Vite-based harness is excellent for rapid development and prototyping, but it's **not a replacement** for PCF's webpack build system. Always validate your components with the official PCF toolchain before deployment to PowerApps.

The fundamental lesson: **develop fast with Vite, deploy with webpack**.
